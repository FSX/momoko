Momoko wraps Psycopg2_'s functionality for use in Tornado_. Have a look at tutorial_ or full documentation_.

**Important:** This is the 2.x version of Momoko. It requires 4.0 <= Tornado < 5.0, uses futures instead of calllbacks
and introduces a slightly different API compared to 1.x version. While transition is very
straightforward, the API is not backward compatible with 1.x!
