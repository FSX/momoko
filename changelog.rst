1.0.0b1 (2012-12-16)
--------------------

This is a beta release. It means that the code has not been tested thoroughly
yet. This first beta release is meant to provide all the functionality of the
previous version plus a few additions.

* Most of the code has been rewritten.
* The mogrify_ method has been added.
* Added support for transactions.
* The query chain and batch have been removed, because ``tornado.gen`` can be used instead.
* Error reporting has bee improved by passing the raised exception to the callback.
  A callback accepts two arguments: the cursor and the error.
* ``Op``, ``WaitOp`` and ``WaitAllOps`` in ``momoko.utils`` are wrappers for
  classes in ``tornado.gen`` which raise the error again when one occurs.
  And the user can capture the exception in the request handler.
* A complete set of tests has been added in the ``momoko`` module: ``momoko.tests``.
  These can be run with ``python setup.py test``.

0.5.0 (2012-07-30)
------------------

* Removed all Adisp related code.
* Refactored connection pool and connection polling.
* Just pass all unspecified arguments to ``BlockingPool`` and ``AsyncPool``. So
  ``connection_factory`` can be used again.

------------------

* Reorganized classes and files.
* Renamed ``momoko.Client`` to ``momoko.AsyncClient``.
* Renamed ``momoko.Pool`` to ``momoko.AsyncPool``.
* Added a client and pool for blocking connections, ``momoko.BlockingClient``
  and ``momoko.BlockingPool``.
* Added ``PoolError`` to the import list in ``__init__.py``.
* Added an example that uses Tornado's gen_ module and Swift_.
* Callbacks are now optional for ``AsyncClient``.
* ``AsyncPool`` and ``Poller`` now accept a ioloop argument. [fzzbt_]
* Unit tests have been added. [fzzbt_]

------------------

* Removed ``executemany`` from ``Momoko``, because it can not be used in asynchronous mode.
* Added a wrapper class, ``Momoko``, for ``Pool``, ``BatchQuery`` and ``QueryChain``.
* Added the ``QueryChain`` class for executing a chain of queries (and callables)
  in a certain order.
* Added the ``BatchQuery`` class for executing batches of queries at the same time.
* Improved ``Pool._clean_pool``. It threw an ``IndexError`` when more than one
  connection needed to be closed.
